This is the frontend of a group demo project of a car leasing application. My main contributions were creating a dynamic car information form that would automatically prefill information from the backend as the user fills in the form. For example, when the user selects the make of a car, the models for that make are fetched from the backend and displayed in a dropdown. When a model is selected, information about that model is fetched and displayed, etc. I also wrote pagination logic for the application list that an administrator sees (more applications are loaded from the backend as the administrator scrolls down the list) and made other smaller contributions.
